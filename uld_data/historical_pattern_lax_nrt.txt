SEASONAL PATTERNS:
Q1: High electronics volume (post-holiday)
Q2: Balanced mix
Q3: Increased automotive parts
Q4: Peak electronics (holiday season)

COMMON LOADING SEQUENCES:
1. Temperature-sensitive cargo (seafood) in forward positions
2. High-value electronics in secure positions
3. Automotive parts in aft positions
4. General cargo fills gaps

WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION:
Forward: 32% of total weight
Center: 42% of total weight
